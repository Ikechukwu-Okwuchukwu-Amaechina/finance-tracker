## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- JavaScript (CommonJS)
- npm

## Authentication API
API endpoints (to be expanded):
- POST /api/auth/signup - create user
- POST /api/auth/login - login and receive JWT
- GET /api/me - get current user and balance (protected)

## Transactions API

All transaction endpoints are protected. Include header Authorization: Bearer <token>

- POST /api/transactions
   - body: { amount: number (>0), type: 'credit'|'debit', description?: string }
   - creates a transaction and adjusts user balance automatically

- GET /api/transactions?page=1&limit=10&type=credit&start=2025-01-01&end=2025-12-31
   - returns paginated transactions filtered by optional type and date range

- GET /api/transactions/:id
   - get a single transaction

- PUT /api/transactions/:id
   - update transaction fields and adjust balance accordingly

- DELETE /api/transactions/:id
   - deletes transaction and adjusts balance accordingly

Security middlewares applied: helmet, rate limiting, mongo sanitization, xss protection, and input validation.

## CI / CD

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs tests on push and PR to `main`.

If you provide a `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret in the repository, the workflow will also attempt to deploy to Railway using the Railway CLI.

To enable Railway deploys:
- Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets (a Railway personal token)
- Ensure the project is connected to a Railway project (you can run `railway init` locally then push)
